to have the context.

NiagaraDataChannels could be used not only to efficently spawn explosions, footsteps and dusts, but also for... numbers.

There is more then 200000 sprite particles of different numbers with different colors and length.
The question, why do we need so much???

A bit about how i accomplished this
* Look and took inspiration from DebugScalarValueNode
* Passing not only the Value of damage, but also length of "damage", color and digit(in case we want to render special symbols) in niagara
* Niagara scales length of sprite plane with length of "damage"
* Niagara passing some of values to material via ParticleColor and DynamicParameter
* To render special characters like "!", lets say when critical strike is accomplished, multipliying damage number by 10 and passing another parameter with digit offset
